## 1. Have a short 21 min screening interview with our CTO

In your first interview you will meet our CTO and Co-Founder Robert and talk about your application, who we are looking for to fill our open positions and if that matches your direction. We'll also talk briefly about the interviewing process, any open questions you might have and schedule dates for all following interviews with you.

## 2. Get to know our product, tech and processes

Your second interview focuses on giving you an insight into our product you will help improve, what value we provide to our customers, the technologies you'll be working with and how we work together and organize ourselves to reach our goals.

This interview is the best opportunity to find out if you find our product interesting, our field of work challenging and our tech stack and way of working appealing, so ask lots of questions!

You'll be joined by our CTO Robert and your mentor-to-be from the same discipline as you. This meeting will take between 1.5 - 2 hours.

We need to know what you can do and how you think, and the third interview is about just that.

To have something to talk about we offer you two options:

#### A) Something existing

You provide us with some existing project/design/code of yours we can have a look at.
This can be some git(hub) repository or a tar/zip file.
Ideally the code should be runnable locally or be already online for us to try it out.


#### B) A coding challenge

Don't worry if you don't have anything to show publicly, you can also do one of our coding challenges.
For the coding challenge, which you should work on for a maximum of 3 hours, we'll invite you to a slack channel, where you can ask as many questions as you like.


<!-- TODO non-code positions? -->

### The actual interview

In the interview proper we'll discuss the something you brought with you.
We're interested in how you approached the problem and how you arrived at your solution and will ask you questions about the thingy and your opinions on some common topics depending on what position you'll apply for. [MAKE THIS HURT LESS]

There will be 0 live coding or whiteboard shenanigans.
