# Cultural Values

- #NoEstimates
- consensus based everything (?)
- collaboration, trust, transparency, something something
- no top-down planning
    - self assign tasks
- work fully remote (prio, office available
- continous process improvement
- LGBTQA+ friendly, fuck NFTs





- No Jira
- No Scrum
- we strive for a good work-life balance.
- Instead of project managers and product owners, you can expect a very modern software stack and a living agile culture that will evolve with you.
- Principles we use: Continuous Delivery, Kanban, and DevOps.



- our Engineering team is not a feature factory: you as developer/team member control through your work how our product will look like in the future - with a lot of responsibility and together with all colleagues. In return
- you can, if desired, talk directly to our customers and users
- we offer software that is actually used productively by thousands of them
- no time tracking
- Flexibility through remote-first, free time management, hardly any (company-) meetings.
